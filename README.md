Console App and Windows Service example

It is a Windows Service skeleton that is also a Console App. It is very convenient for the developer to test such a Windows service. Because it can also run as a Console application. At the same time, it is a Windows service that can be installed to Windows system. This is convenient when the same software has several simple launch approaches.

I've been using this in my projects for a while now and decided to create this public example that might be useful to someone.
